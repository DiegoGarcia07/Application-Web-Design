## *Personal touch*
### Favorite Quote:
"A person learns to live throughout their entire life, and their entire life should be spent learning to die." - Seneca

### Personal Philosophy:
My personal philosophy revolves around the idea that life is a constant state of change, filled with probabilities and uncertainties. Despite the challenges, we always put on our best face to exist because it's either that or face oblivion. Therefore, why not question everything, recognizing that our understanding is limited, and life can change in a second? It's about seeking balance but, more importantly, questioning whether the decisions we make in our daily lives are truly worthwhile. Do they justify the sacrifices and rewards, or are they mere trivialities that contribute nothing? It's about evaluating whether our actions lead us to a better place or if they are merely obligations.
