# About the project
In this project you will find an CRUD of a bookstore, it uses laravel framewrok, this is based on MVC which is very useful when  you know what to do wth the routes and logic of a project.
In the view we could find the index view, which is the main view thwts why it use a table to show the data, because  it is very easy to understand and manage, I have to clear something, The project wont work at all if the fields are null, so you have to fill with at leats one record the database.
Another thing is the routes which we have one for every single view, index, edit and create, and another three to update, create, and delete, show or get it is manage by the views and the controller.
The controller has the logic for every single view, route, model, and method, so this is the brain of all, and many of the methods are very similar to others, due to this interaction.
And finally we have the model and database or migration, in the migration we have all the fields that the database has, and in the model we only access or get all the information to after display by the controller in the index view.
